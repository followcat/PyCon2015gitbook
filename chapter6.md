Brief Theory of Gradual Typing
* Magic **Any** type
* Non-transitive **consistency** relation
    * tuanA T: Any~T
* Undeclared types are considered type Any.

PEP 483, 484
* New typing.py module
 * Any, Union, Iterable, TypeVar, ...
* Type are still hints, external validation
* Stub files, overloads


* Current focus on type safety
* Partial step forward for tools like Cython
